## Instant MCP User Session

Thanks for doing this user session with me! We're going to build an app together
using Instant with the MCP and some context! Let's get started!

## Quick Start

1. Press the button below to clone this repository and deploy it to Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnezaj%2Finstant-mcp-eph)

Walk through the deployment process and you should see the default Next app live!

2. Let's clone the repository to our local machine and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_NAME> instant-user-session
cd instant-user-session
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```


Huzzah! We're up and running. Now let's start hacking!
